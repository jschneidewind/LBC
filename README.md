# LBC

Logistic baseline correction (LBC) is a general background correction method for baseline-varying signals.

# Dependencies

Basic LBC and reaction kinetics analysis require NumPy and SciPy, as well as Matplotlib for visualization.

qPCR analysis addtionally requires Pandas, statsmodels and timeit.

X-Ray absorption spectroscopy analysis requires Larch in addition to NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.
